/**************
 Function Triangle(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2, float x3, float y3, float r, float g, float b)

 draws a triangle connecting points (x1,y1)  (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), colored with the (r,g,b) specified color.
 vertex are expressed in Normalized screen coordinates, (i.e. in range [-1,+1]), following the Vulkan convention.
 The red, green and blue (r,g,b) values are in the range [0,1].
 
 Using function Triangle(...) try to draw a children house, similar to the one below.
 
 First remove the two function below (given only as an example), and replace them with your own.
 Since it is a C program, you can use for loops if you think it can be helpful in your drawing.
 The for() command below that draws a sun like shape in exact center of the screen near the top,
 is an example on how you can use it: please remove it, and replace it with your own code.
 It is not necessery to use a for loop if you do not really need it: it has been put here only as
 an example to help students not familiar with C++.
